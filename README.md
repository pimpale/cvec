# cvec
## C Vector

This is a very simple implementation of a vector in C. It supports dynamic expansion, but not dynamic freeing. The default pattern is to directly return a pointer to memory guaranteed to be valid until the next operation. This is not intended to be thread safe. Feel free to use this for any purpose.
